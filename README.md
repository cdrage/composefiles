# Docker Compose Files

Unless otherwise stated, simple run `docker-compose up` in each folder!

All compose files use `version: '2'` of the API, so this requires: `docker 1.10+` and `docker-compose 1.6+`.

## Sensu Server

Monitoring server

#### Configuration

Before deployment, generate the appropriate SSL certs with:
```sh
./gen-ssl.sh
```

These certs will be located within the SSL folder of the working directory.

#### Files

In order to deploy sensu-clients, use the /ssl/client certs.

Feel free to edit `sensu-checks.json` and `sensu.json` to your liking. This including setting your slack server as well as any email notifications.

## CouchPotato

Disclaimer: I'm not responsible for whatever you do with these Docker images. Use at your own risk.

This is a docker-compose file of couchpotato, transmission as well as plex.

#### Configuration

Your files will be located under ./media folder in the current directory.
Same with the plex configuration data.

The files used for persistent storage upon container re-creation are as follows:
```sh
./media # media storage
./plex_config # config data
./couchpotato_config # config data
```
The instructions below will show how to create these persistent configuration folders.

There's a few steps before you're 100% ready to-go.

  1. 
```
mkdir media plex_config couchpotato_config
chown 797:797 -R media plex_config couchpotato_config
```
  2. run `docker run --rm -it wernight/plex-media-server retrieve-plex-token` to find your Plex Token. Plug it into the `docker-compose.yaml` file where KEYHERE is located.
  3. `docker-compose up`
  4. Go to Couch Potato (http://localhost:5050)
  5. While going through the setup, set your downloader to Transmission with the credentials:
    http://transmission:9091
    admin
    admin
  6. Run through the rest of the Couch Potato setup
  7. Go to Plex (http://localhost:32400/web)
  8. Sign in, add your server (should automatically appear as you added the Plex Token). When adding media, simply add the /media folder from the root directory of the server.
